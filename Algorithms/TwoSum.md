## Step 1: Verify the constraint
###### 1. Are all of the numbers positive or can there be negatives?
###### All of the numbers are positive
------
###### 2. Are there duplicate numbers in the array?
###### No, there are no duplicates
------
###### 3. Will there always be a solution available? (Meaning, given the array and the target, will we always be able to find two numbers in the array that will add up to this target here?)
###### No, There may not always be a solution.
------
###### 4. What do we return if there is no solution?
###### Just return null
------
###### 5. Can there be multiple pairs that add up to the target?
###### No, Only one pair of numbers will add up to the target.

## Step 2: Write out some of these test cases
## Step 3: Figure out a solution without code
## Step 4: Write out our solution in code
