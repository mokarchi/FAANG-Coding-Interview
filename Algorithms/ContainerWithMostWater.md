## Step 1: Verify the constraint
###### 1. Does the thickness of the lines affect the area?
###### No, assume they take up no space
------
###### 2. Do the left and right size of the graph count as walls?
###### No, the sides cannot be used to form a container
------
###### 3. Does a higher line inside our container affect our area?
###### No lines inside a container don't affect the area

## Step 2: Write out some of these test cases
